Coursework from Rutgers University - New Brunswick: Internet Technology (CS 352).

All projects were done with partner Kruti Shah during Spring 2022 semester. 

Projects uploaded have received full marks. These projects have significant contribution (80-90%) from me. Projects 2, 4, and 5 have been omitted as Kruti gave most contribution to those submissions.
